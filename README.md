# «ChronoLogical»

This web application allows users to create and compare timelines in order to identify temporal relationships between events.

Users are asked to sign up and log in to use the application. The **Main** page allows the user to compare either public timelines, private timelines, or both. On the **My Timelines** page, users can create new timelines, add events to an existing timeline, and modify existing events.

This full-stack project features user authentication (Passport), template handling (Handlebars), and database management (MySQL). [Timeline](https://squarechip.github.io/timeline/#vertical-demo) was used to dynamically generate the timelines.
